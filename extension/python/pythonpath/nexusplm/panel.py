"""What the sidebar panel shows, decided without LibreOffice anywhere near it.

The panel itself is UNO plumbing — a container window, some labels, some buttons — and none of
that can be tested without an office running. What can be tested is every decision it makes: which
rows to show, what to put in them when a value is missing, which buttons a document in this state
may use, and what to say when there is no document at all. Those live here, as functions over the
answer ``/plm/state`` gives, so the panel is left with nothing to get wrong on its own.
