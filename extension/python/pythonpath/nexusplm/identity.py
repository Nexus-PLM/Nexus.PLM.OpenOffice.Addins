"""Which PLM item a document on disk is — the one resolution rule, in one place.

This exists because there are two callers and they disagreed. The toolbar asked the note this
add-in had written down and only then asked the service; the sidebar asked the service by path and
nothing else. So a document the add-in had registered seconds earlier showed a full toolbar and a
panel that said "This document is not in PLM", with every button greyed.

The order matters and is not an optimisation:

``/plm/state?file_path=`` resolves a document by the **part number in its file name**, because
every dataset the vault stages is named by its part number. That works for a file PLM handed over
and not for one PLM adopted where it already sat — Save As New registers a document under its own
name, so `calc-host-test.ods` is item AUD-000014 and its name says nothing about that. The note
this add-in wrote is the only thing that knows.

The note is confirmed against the service rather than trusted: the item may have been deleted since,
and the answer carries the current status anyway. A note that no longer resolves is dropped, so a
stale one cannot keep a document pinned to an item that is gone.
