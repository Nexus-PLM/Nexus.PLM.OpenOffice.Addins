``GET /plm/navigation/folders`` answers one flat list, every folder carrying its own
``parent_id``. A tree control wants the opposite — roots, each with its children — so the
nesting is worked out here, where it can be tested without an office running.

The endpoint is the Word Navigation pane's (``FolderBrowserServicesAdapter``), so the pane,
Word's pane and the Open dialog cannot disagree about what a folder contains.
