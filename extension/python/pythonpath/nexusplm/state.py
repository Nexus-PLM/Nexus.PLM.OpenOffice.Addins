"""Which PLM item each document on this machine is.

Every PLM command needs to know what the document in front of the user is. Asking the service by
file path does not answer it: ``/plm/state?file_path=`` searches the Engine for an object carrying
that path as an attribute, and on a live server that search returns nothing — for a document this
add-in had created a moment earlier, and for a Word document that has been checked in for months.
Everything then refuses with "This document is not registered in PLM."

So the add-in records it, the way the Office add-ins do (``PlmDocumentState`` there): every handler
that learns which item a file is writes it down, keyed by the file's path, and every handler that
needs one reads it back. The service is still asked when nothing is remembered, so a path the
service *can* resolve still works.

The file is small, per user, and rewritten atomically — a half-written map would lose every
document at once. Nothing here is a cache of PLM's truth: it holds an identifier, and the current
status is always asked of the service with it.
