"""The UNO component behind the toolbar's stacked buttons.

A toolbar button that opens a menu — Save ▾, Tasks ▾, Values ▾ — is not something Addons.xcu can
describe on its own. What makes one is a *toolbar controller* registered against the button's
command URL (Controller.xcu): when the toolbar is built, LibreOffice sees that the command has a
controller and hands the button to it. This file is that controller, once, serving every stacked
button by the command it was created for. Pressing the button opens a popup menu of the group's
commands under it.

It is loaded by LibreOffice's Python component loader, not by the script provider that runs
``nexus_commands.py`` — the manifest names it as a UNO component. The loader sets ``__file__`` and
puts ``pythonpath/`` beside it on ``sys.path``, so the shared package imports as usual. The
``g_exportedScripts`` at the bottom is empty so the script provider, which also scans this folder,
offers nothing from here as a macro.

Choosing an entry dispatches the same ``vnd.sun.star.script:`` URL the flat toolbar and the menu
use, through the frame, so a command behaves identically wherever it was reached from.
