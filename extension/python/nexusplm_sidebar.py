"""The Nexus PLM sidebar deck - a real docked panel, built from UNO controls.

LibreOffice asks a *UI element factory* for a panel whose ImplementationURL names it
(Factories.xcu), and the factory answers with a *UI element* whose real interface is a window
(Sidebar.xcu). This file is both halves.

Why controls and not a browser: LibreOffice draws its whole UI itself inside one top-level window.
Measured on 26.2 - the frame window hands back a Win32 handle, but the component window and any
child created through the toolkit expose no system-dependent interface at all, and
``EnumChildWindows`` on the frame returns **zero** children. A panel is a painted rectangle, not a
window, so there is nothing for a native control to be parented onto; and the frame does not set
``WS_CLIPCHILDREN``, so anything parented to *it* would be painted over on every repaint. The panel
is therefore drawn with the toolkit's own controls, which is also the only version that works
anywhere but Windows.

The panel shows what PLM knows about the document in front of you and offers the commands that
document's state allows. Every one of those decisions is in ``nexusplm.panel``, tested without an
office; what is here is the plumbing that cannot be.
