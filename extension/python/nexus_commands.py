"""The functions LibreOffice calls when a Nexus PLM toolbar button or menu item is used.

One function per command, each named in ``Addons.xcu``. The set is the Word add-in's, minus the two
that have no meaning here (Markup and Apply Markups, which are about Word's comments and tracked
changes) and the Navigator pane, which needs a docked WebView the office does not offer.

They are deliberately thin: every command asks the service to do the work, because the service owns
the session, the dialogs and the toasts. The only things decided here are the ones only the host can
know — which document is in front of the user, whether it has unsaved edits, what this host is able
to open, and what the document's fields currently hold.

Every function catches everything. An exception escaping into UNO is reported to the user as an
unhelpful scripting error, and in the worst case takes the frame down with it.
