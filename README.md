# Nexus PLM for LibreOffice

Product lifecycle management from inside LibreOffice. Create a document from a PLM template, check
it out, edit its attributes, check it back in — in Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw and Math, without
leaving the application.

The add-in is a Python UNO extension packaged as an `.oxt`. It talks to the **Nexus PLM Addin
Service** on `localhost:5100`, which owns the dialogs and does the talking to the PLM server — so
the same windows, wording and behaviour appear in LibreOffice, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and FreeCAD.

---

## What it does

Twenty-two commands, on a toolbar, a menu, and stacked dropdowns:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Documents** | New from Template · Open from PLM · Search |
| **Saving** | Save to PLM · Save As New Item · Save As Existing Item |
| **Lifecycle** | Check Out · Check In · Revise · Change Ownership |
| **Workflow** | My Worklist · New Workflow |
| **Values** | Properties · Edit Values · Refresh Values · Reload Document |
| **Session** | Sign In · Sign Out · Current Settings · Connection Status · Help · About |

There is deliberately no Release. A revision reaches Released only by running a workflow, which
New Workflow starts: the workflow's Status node sets the lifecycle through the Engine, with the
approvals that workflow declares. The web client has never offered a Release action either.

A document created from a PLM template opens filled in — part number, revision, description,
whoever created it and when — because the type says which PLM attribute feeds which document field.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/edit-values.png" alt="Edit Values, with each row's direction" width="49%">
  <img src="docs/revise.png" alt="Revise, offering major or minor" width="49%">
</p>

**Edit Values** (left) shows every mapped attribute and honours the direction the type declares:
a value PLM owns is shown and locked, one the document owns is editable, and identity and audit
fields are never editable whatever a mapping says. **Revise** (right) offers the revisions the
server would actually create, under that type's own revisioning scheme.

### The sidebar

![The Nexus PLM deck docked in Writer](docs/sidebar.png)

A docked **Nexus PLM** deck, in all five applications, showing what PLM knows about the document in
front of you and offering only the commands its state allows: Check Out is greyed on a document
already checked out to you, Check In and Save on one that is not yours to save.

It is built from LibreOffice's own controls rather than hosting a web view, and that is a measured
decision rather than a preference — see *A sidebar panel is not a window* below.

## How it fits together

```
LibreOffice  ──UNO──►  this extension  ──HTTP──►  Addin Service  ──►  Nexus PLM Engine
 (Writer …)            (Python, .oxt)            (localhost:5100)      Vault, types, workflow
                                                        │
                                   the dialogs a user sees live here,
                                   shared by every host: Word, Excel,
                                   PowerPoint, FreeCAD, LibreOffice
```

The extension keeps no business rules of its own. It says what it is and what it can open — the
service needs no code changes to gain a new host — writes PLM's values into the document, and asks
the service for everything else.

One piece runs on both sides: **`Nexus.PLM.OpenOffice.Templates`**, a small .NET library that
reads and writes OpenDocument metadata over a zip, with no LibreOffice needed. The Vault loads it
server-side to discover what fields a template has; the add-in uses the same rules client-side, so
a value written into an open document and the same value written into a closed one are the same
value.

## Installing

Download `NexusPLM.oxt` from a [release](../../releases) and install it:

```
unopkg add NexusPLM.oxt
```

or double-click it in LibreOffice (**Tools ▸ Extension Manager ▸ Add**). LibreOffice must be
closed when installing from the command line.

You will also need the Nexus PLM Addin Service running locally — it is what the add-in talks to,
and it is what shows the dialogs.

## Building

```bash
# the extension (writes dist/NexusPLM.oxt) — needs only Python 3
python extension/build.py

# build and install in one step; close LibreOffice first
python extension/build.py --install

# the connector and its tests
dotnet test Nexus.PLM.OpenOffice.Templates.Tests

# the add-in's own Python
python -m unittest discover -s tests/python
```

`build.py` refuses to pack an extension whose menus name a command the scripts do not export, or an
icon a mapping does not have — both of which fail silently inside LibreOffice otherwise.

## Repository layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `extension/` | The `.oxt`: manifest, menu and toolbar definitions, icons, and the Python that runs inside LibreOffice. |
| `extension/python/nexus_commands.py` | One function per command — the whole surface a user touches. |
| `extension/python/pythonpath/nexusplm/` | `client.py` (the service), `document.py` (UNO), `odf.py` (the package on disk), `state.py` (which item a file is). |
| `extension/python/nexusplm_controllers.py` | The UNO component behind the toolbar's stacked dropdowns. |
| `extension/python/nexusplm_sidebar.py` | The UNO component behind the docked sidebar deck. |
| `Nexus.PLM.OpenOffice.Templates/` | The ODF connector, .NET, `netstandard2.0` + `net8.0`. |
| `Nexus.PLM.OpenOffice.Templates.Tests/` | 61 tests, including one that makes LibreOffice itself reopen a file the connector rewrote. |
| `tests/python/` | 74 tests over the add-in's own logic — no LibreOffice required. |

## Design notes

Things that cost something to learn, kept here so they are not learned twice.

**One connector for five applications.** Every LibreOffice format is an OpenDocument package, and
all five keep user-defined fields in the same `meta.xml` under the same schema. One implementation
covers Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw and Math, differing only in MIME type and which field kinds a
document can hold.

**A host declares its own capabilities.** What this add-in can open travels with each request, so
adding a host needs no service change. If a host seems to need one, it is usually declaring the
wrong thing.

**The staged file is written before the office opens it.** Values written into a document only
once it is open depend on a later save happening; the file on disk is what Check In uploads, what a
backup captures, and what a colleague opens.

**A value has to be somewhere you can see it.** Every application carries user fields, but only
Writer can show one in the body and only Calc can show one in a cell; a slide, a drawing page and
a formula have nothing that displays a user field. So the add-in writes, by the same rule as the
server's connector, into **named frames and shapes** as well — in the staged file and in the
document on screen — and the name is the field. Name a text box `NXPartNumber` in Impress or Draw
(Format ▸ Name…) and the part number appears in it; an unnamed box is not a field, because
LibreOffice stores no name on a shape nobody named. The text goes into the first paragraph, inside
its first run, so the font, size and colour the author chose survive. Math has neither shapes nor
frames, so its values live in File ▸ Properties only.

**A staged file that could not be rewritten is said, not opened in silence.** It used to answer
the same `False` as "nothing needed doing", so a locked file opened as an untitled copy with no
word of why. Now the user is told, the cause is in the add-in log, and the file opens as it was
staged with the values written into the open document instead.

**A template is not a document.** A file staged from a type's template still says it is a template
— in its `mimetype` *and* in its manifest — and an office opens a template by making an untitled
copy and leaving the file alone. Both declarations are corrected before anything opens it.

**One typing rule, shared.** A date, a number and a flag each have one lexical form, written the
same way whether the document is open or closed. `OdfValueWrite` is that rule on the .NET side and
`odf.py` mirrors it exactly.

**A sidebar panel is not a window.** The deck is drawn with UNO controls, not by hosting a browser,
because there is nothing to host one *in*. LibreOffice draws its entire interface itself inside one
top-level window: on 26.2 the frame window hands back a Win32 handle, but the document window and a
child made through the toolkit expose no system-dependent interface at all, and enumerating the
frame's child windows returns **zero**. A panel is a painted rectangle. Parenting a native control
to the frame instead would mean tracking that rectangle by hand — and the frame does not set
`WS_CLIPCHILDREN`, so the office would paint over the control on every repaint. It would also be
Windows-only. The same reasoning is why the toolbar's dropdowns are a UNO toolbar controller.

**Whitespace inside a configuration value is part of the value.** A `ContextList` laid out prettily
across several indented lines comes back with the newline and the indentation still inside it, so
the application name is not `WriterVariants` and nothing ever matches: the deck appears in the rail
and opens empty, with nothing logged. Its entries also each contain commas, so the list separator must
be `;`. Both are checked by `build.py` now, because neither fails loudly.

**Not the .NET/CLI UNO bridge.** It was considered and ruled out on evidence: of the five managed
assemblies it needs, LibreOffice 26.2 ships none. Python UNO is the supported path.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please:

- keep a change and its test together — every fix here came from something observed, and the test
  says what was observed;
- run both suites before opening a pull request;
- describe *why* in the commit body, not only what.

The round-trip test that drives LibreOffice reports as **skipped** where LibreOffice is absent,
never as passed — a green tick for an assurance nobody has is worse than no test.
